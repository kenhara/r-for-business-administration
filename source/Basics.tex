\subsection{Importing Data}
Using Rcmdr, select Data then drop down to Import Data to import a dataset based (categorized by file format). If you are using R Script, read.table is the most common command to do this. There are many compatible file formats and ways to import data into R, find support for specific common file types below, or online.

Importing CSV Files

Using R Script and read.table, note whether your CSV has a header or not. If it does, mark TRUE. If not, mark FALSE.

Dataset <-  read.table("/filename.csv", header = FALSE, sep = ",")

Importing ODS Files

It is possible to import ODS file (an Open Document Format spreadsheet) directly into R after installing a separate package called readODS. Once installed, this is an example of an R Script command to import an ODS file:

read.ods(file = NULL, sheet = NULL, formulaAsFormula = FALSE)

There are several arguments you can use with this command, find a more detailed walkthrough online here: \texttt{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readODS/readODS.pdf}
